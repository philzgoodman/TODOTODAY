# TodoToday


 
SUMMARY

A cross-platform productivity app to manage your to-dos much faster than other tools (trust). Lay out your backlog of tasks and determine what you need to do today across any number of projects. Features a hashtagging system to stay organized. Designed for faster text input, regardless of platform, with a persistent chat-style input box to add tasks with minimal number of clicks (by comparison, it takes 2-3x less clicks compared to inputting tasks into a Notion DB). 


BACKGROUND INFO

There is minimal mental context-switching in this app which means no annoying dialogs and UI changes just to add a simple to-do. Made in Flutter and supported by Firebase for syncing data across iOS, Android, and Web. I made this app based on my own personal productivity system: Google Tasks is poor at supporting multiple projects. Notion allows you to funnel many projects into one list, but is far too cumbersome. TodoToday will get approved and published to Google Play and the App Store in the near future.
